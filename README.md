# Project Management Dashboard

This is a modern, interactive project management dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, Three.js and Tailwind CSS. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing tasks through a Kanban-style board, complete with drag-and-drop functionality, dynamic AI-powered UI elements, and a responsive design that works across all devices.
